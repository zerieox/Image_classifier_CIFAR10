## Project Overview

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 distinct classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify images into one of the ten categories in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracting features from images.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reducing spatial dimensions.
- **Dropout Layers:** Preventing overfitting.
- **Dense Layers:** Classifying the features into labels.
